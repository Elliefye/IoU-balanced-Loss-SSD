# SSD (Single-Shot MultiBox Detector) with DR loss
 
A super simple SSD implementation using PyTorch, replacing Cross Entropy loss with DR loss.

Based on https://github.com/uvipen/SSD-pytorch (using ResNet50 as a backbone instead of VGG-16)

Configured for a subset of OIDv6 dataset: Horse, Knife and Human body classes.
